# diamond_output_parser

### Usage: Diamond_parser.py /path/to/dir/with/files/

Output:
1) Text file containing organisms of interest and the number of reads assigned to them
	- currently this is a fixed list within the script, later versions will have this as something you can provide

2) Pdf containing the graphed proportion of reads assigned to each organism of interest to root reads
	- Multi-page pdf
	- One graph per sample
	- Eventually this will be changed to percentage of total reads provided rather than root

- this also contains a "positive control" which is just a marker to show you where 1% of the root reads sit on the graph

Lots of improvements still need to be made!!
- Nicer graphs
- Maybe the option of combining graphs together and colour-coding the samples so it's all on one graph
- More comments in the script itself



### Trial_DMND Folder
- Contains two examples and what their output should look like
